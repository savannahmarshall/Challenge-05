# Project Task Board

## Description
This application functions as a simple task board that allows a team to manage project tasks. As a project team member, I want to be able to organize multiple tasks by adding individual project tasks, managing their state of progress and track overall progress accordingly.

## Usage
Upon viewing the page, you will see three columns where you can place tasks depending on their progress state: to do, in progress, and done. To add a task, click the green "add task" button under the header. After clicking the button, the user is presented with a modal where information for task title, due date and task description can be entered. For the due date, the difference in days between the due date and current date are calculated using a function that finds the difference in milliseconds and converts it to days. Based on what day is entered, the card color will be red if the due date has passed, yellow if it is due soon (within 3 days of the due date) and white if it is outside of the 3 day window.
